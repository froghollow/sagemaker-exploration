# Sagemaker Exploration
## Exploring PySpark and PyDeequ with Amazon SageMaker 

[Amazon SageMaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/whatis.html) is a fully managed machine learning service. With SageMaker, data scientists and developers can quickly and easily build and train machine learning models, and then directly deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment.

We are using SageMaker compute instances running [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) not only for analytical coding, but also for building services with AWS resources using the AWS Python SDK (boto3).

PyDeequ is a Python API for Deequ, a library built on top of Apache Spark for defining "unit tests for data", which measure data quality in large datasets. PyDeequ is written to support usage of Deequ in Python.   We are looking to leverage PyDeequ for analyzing and improving Data Quality.

This repository contains a review and examples of Deequ and PyDeequ, and some examples of how we can use it for our
